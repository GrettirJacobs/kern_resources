# Security Measures for Kern Resources

**Date:** April 7, 2025
**Author:** Kern Resources Team

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Kern Resources project to protect sensitive information such as API keys and other credentials.

## Security Measures

### 1. API Key Management

#### Environment Variables

We use environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Separation of Code and Credentials**: API keys are not hardcoded in the source code
2. **Reduced Risk of Exposure**: Keys are not committed to the repository
3. **Flexibility**: Different environments (development, staging, production) can use different keys
4. **Standard Practice**: This is an industry-standard approach for handling sensitive information

### Implementation

We've implemented a secure environment manager (`utils/env_manager.py`) that provides:

1. **Secure Loading**: Loads environment variables from `.env` files
2. **Secure Access**: Provides methods for securely accessing API keys and other sensitive information
3. **Logging**: Logs masked versions of API keys for debugging purposes
4. **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages when keys are missing

### Usage

```python
from utils.env_manager import env_manager

# Get an API key
api_key = env_manager.get_api_key("GROQ")

# Get a model name
model = env_manager.get_model("GROQ")

# Get any environment variable
value = env_manager.get("VARIABLE_NAME", "default_value")
```

#### .env Files

We use `.env` files to store environment variables locally. These files are:

1. **Never Committed**: `.env` files are listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
2. **Template Provided**: We provide a `.env.example` file as a template for required variables
3. **Local Only**: Each developer maintains their own `.env` file with their own API keys

### Example .env File

```
# GroqCloud Configuration
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
GROQ_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
```

#### Deployment Security

For deployment on Render, we use Render's built-in environment variable management:

1. **Secure Storage**: API keys are stored securely in Render's environment variable system
2. **No Exposure**: Keys are never exposed in logs or error messages
3. **Access Control**: Only authorized users can access the environment variables

### Setting Up Environment Variables on Render

1. Go to the Render dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Go to the "Environment" tab
4. Add your environment variables (e.g., `GROQ_API_KEY`)
5. Save the changes

### 2. Request Validation

We've implemented request validation to ensure that all inputs are properly validated and sanitized before processing:

#### Input Validation

We use a request validator (`utils/request_validator.py`) that provides:

1. **API Key Validation**: Validates API keys for proper format and length
2. **Model Name Validation**: Validates model names for proper format
3. **Parameter Validation**: Validates parameters like temperature and max_tokens
4. **Message Validation**: Validates chat messages for proper format
5. **Request Validation**: Validates complete API requests

#### Implementation

```python
from utils.request_validator import request_validator, ValidationError

try:
    # Validate an API key
    request_validator.validate_api_key(api_key)

    # Validate a model name
    request_validator.validate_model_name(model_name, "GROQ")

    # Validate a chat request
    request_validator.validate_chat_request(request)

    # Sanitize input
    sanitized_input = request_validator.sanitize_input(user_input)
except ValidationError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Validation error: {e}")
```

#### Input Sanitization

We sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks:

1. **Character Filtering**: Removes potentially dangerous characters
2. **Type Checking**: Ensures inputs are of the expected type
3. **Value Validation**: Validates values against expected ranges or patterns

#### Error Handling

We handle validation errors gracefully:

1. **Validation Exceptions**: Raise specific exceptions for validation errors
2. **Logging**: Log validation errors for debugging
3. **Default Values**: Use safe default values when validation fails
4. **Sanitization**: Attempt to sanitize inputs when validation fails

### 3. Code Security

We've implemented several security measures in the code:

1. **Masked Logging**: API keys are masked in logs (e.g., `gsk_1234...5678`)
2. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages when keys are missing
3. **Dependency Management**: Graceful handling of missing dependencies
4. **Path Management**: Secure handling of file paths

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never Commit API Keys**: Never commit `.env` files or hardcode API keys in source code
2. **Rotate Keys Regularly**: Regularly rotate API keys, especially after potential exposure
3. **Use Unique Keys**: Use different API keys for different environments
4. **Limit Access**: Only share API keys with those who need them
5. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly monitor API usage for unusual activity

### For Deployment

1. **Use Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables for sensitive information
2. **Secure Transmission**: Use HTTPS for all API requests
3. **Limit Permissions**: Use the principle of least privilege for API keys
4. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse with rate limiting
5. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review logs for security issues

## Future Enhancements

We plan to implement additional security measures in the future:

1. **API Key Rotation**: Automated rotation of API keys
2. **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of API requests per time period
3. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Automated monitoring and alerting for unusual activity
4. **Access Control**: Role-based access control for API keys
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all API key usage

## Testing

We've implemented a test script (`utils/test_env_manager.py`) to verify that the environment manager is working correctly. This script:

1. Tests that API keys can be loaded and accessed
2. Tests that model names can be loaded and accessed
3. Tests that general environment variables can be accessed

To run the test:

```bash
python run_env_test.py
```

## Conclusion

By implementing these security measures, we've significantly reduced the risk of exposing sensitive information such as API keys. We'll continue to improve our security practices as the project evolves.
