# Kern Resources Creative Lab

This directory contains experimental and innovative components for the Kern Resources project. The Creative Lab is where we explore new technologies, implement cutting-edge AI capabilities, and develop features that will eventually be integrated into the main application.

## Overview

The Creative Lab is organized into several sub-projects:

- **[llama4_exp](./llama4_exp/)**: Experiments with Meta's Llama 4 models
- **[dream_lab](./dream_lab/)**: Implementation of AI dreaming and continuous learning
- **[crew_ai](./crew_ai/)**: Integration with CrewAI for multi-agent collaboration
- **[research](./research/)**: Documentation of research findings and ideas

## Recent Accomplishments

### Llama 4 Integration

We've successfully integrated Meta's Llama 4 models into the Kern Resources project:

- Implemented OllamaProvider for local and remote Llama 4 inference
- Created deployment options for Render, GroqCloud, and other cloud services
- Documented cost comparisons and performance considerations
- Set up testing and example scripts

### Dream Lab Implementation

We've developed a novel system for AI dreaming and continuous learning:

- Created a multi-agent architecture with lead, expert, and base models
- Implemented memory and reflection systems for knowledge retention
- Developed dream-time exploration for creative problem-solving
- Built continuous learning mechanisms for model improvement

### CrewAI Integration

We've integrated CrewAI with GroqCloud to create powerful multi-agent systems:

- Implemented GroqCloudProvider for cost-effective Llama 4 inference
- Created high-level integration modules for easy agent creation
- Developed example scripts for resource discovery and recommendation
- Set up testing and validation tools

## Future Development Plans

Our prioritized development roadmap:

1. **Security Measures**
   - API key management
