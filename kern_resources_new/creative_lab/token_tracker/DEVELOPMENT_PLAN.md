# Token Tracker Development Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Components Overview

The Token Tracker system consists of several key components:

1. **Proxy Server**
   - Built on LiteLLM
   - Intercepts API calls to track token usage
   - Implements rate limiting
   - Calculates costs based on token usage
   - Status: **Partially Implemented**

2. **Database Layer**
   - SQLAlchemy models for data persistence
   - Models for token usage, rate limits, budgets, and alerts
   - Status: **Implemented with Schema Issues**

3. **API Layer**
   - Flask-based REST API
   - Endpoints for token usage, rate limits, and budgets
   - JWT authentication
   - Status: **Implemented with Testing Issues**

4. **Dashboard**
   - Dash/Plotly-based web interface
   - Visualizations for token usage and costs
   - Controls for rate limits and budgets
   - Status: **Partially Implemented**

5. **Notification System**
   - Email alerts for budget thresholds
   - Status: **Implemented with Testing Issues**

6. **Authentication & Security**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - API key encryption
   - Status: **Implemented with Testing Issues**

7. **Docker Deployment**
   - Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
   - Status: **Implemented but Untested**

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Architecture**: The system has a well-thought-out architecture covering all aspects of token tracking and management.
2. **Solid Database Models**: The database models are well-designed and cover all necessary entities.
3. **Good Test Coverage**: The test suite covers most components with 48 passing tests.
4. **Security Features**: The system includes authentication, authorization, and encryption.
5. **Containerization**: Docker support for easy deployment.

### Issues and Gaps

1. **Schema Mismatches**: There are discrepancies between the database schema used in tests and the actual schema:
   - `user_id` column in the `token_usage` table
   - `slack_webhook` column in the `budget_alerts` table

2. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The proxy server's token tracking middleware is not fully implemented
   - The dashboard's rate limit visualization is a placeholder
   - The integration between components needs improvement

3. **Testing Issues**:
   - Some tests are skipped due to schema mismatches
   - Environment dependencies for notification tests

4. **Missing Documentation**:
   - API documentation is incomplete
   - Code-level documentation needs improvement

5. **Deployment Concerns**:
   - Docker deployment is untested
   - Production-ready configuration is missing

## Development Plan

- Create user guides for each component

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancement

#### 2.1 Advanced Rate Limiting (Priority: High)
- Implement more sophisticated rate limiting strategies
- Add support for custom rate limit periods
- Implement rate limit overrides for specific users

#### 2.2 Enhanced Dashboard (Priority: Medium)
- Add more visualizations for token usage patterns
- Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
- Add user management interface

- Set up alerting for system issues

#### 3.4 Production Deployment (Priority: High)
- Test and refine Docker deployment
- Create production-ready configuration
- Document deployment process

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

#### 4.1 AI-Powered Analytics (Priority: Low)
- Implement token usage prediction
- Add anomaly detection for unusual usage patterns
- Provide cost optimization recommendations

#### 4.2 Multi-Provider Support (Priority: Medium)
- Add support for more LLM providers
- Implement provider fallback strategies
- Add provider cost comparison

#### 4.3 Custom Reporting (Priority: Low)
- Add support for custom reports
- Implement report scheduling
- Add export options (CSV, PDF, etc.)

## Next Steps (Immediate Actions)

1. **Align Database Schema**:
   - Update the `TokenUsage` model to include the `user_id` column
   - Update the `BudgetAlert` model to include the `slack_webhook` column
   - Create database migration scripts using Alembic

2. **Fix Test Issues**:
   - Update the test fixtures to match the new schema
   - Fix the skipped tests
   - Improve test environment setup

3. **Complete Proxy Implementation**:
   - Finish implementing the token tracking middleware
   - Add support for more LLM providers
   - Improve error handling

4. **Enhance Dashboard**:
   - Complete the rate limit visualization
   - Add more token usage visualizations
   - Improve the user interface

## Conclusion

The Token Tracker project has a solid foundation with a well-designed architecture and good test coverage. However, there are several issues and gaps that need to be addressed before it can be considered production-ready. The development plan outlined above provides a roadmap for addressing these issues and enhancing the system with new features.

The immediate focus should be on stabilizing the foundation by aligning the database schema, fixing test issues, completing the proxy implementation, and enhancing the dashboard. Once these tasks are completed, the system can be further enhanced with advanced features and optimized for production deployment.
