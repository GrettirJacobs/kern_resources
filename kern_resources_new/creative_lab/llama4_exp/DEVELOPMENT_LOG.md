# Llama 4 Integration Development Log

## April 7, 2025: Deployment Options Exploration

After implementing the initial Llama 4 integration code, we explored various deployment options for running Llama 4 models, considering hardware requirements, costs, and practical implementation approaches.

Key findings:

1. **Hardware Requirements**: Llama 4 Scout Instruct (8B) requires minimum 16GB VRAM, while Llama 4 E (17B) requires minimum 32GB VRAM.

2. **Local Hardware Limitations**: Our available GPU (11GB VRAM) is sufficient for Llama 3 7B but insufficient for Llama 4 models.

3. **Cloud Options**:
   - Render.com GPU instances (A4000): Technically viable but cost-prohibitive at ~$225/month
   - Google Colab Pro: Best balance of capability and cost at $9.99/month with A100 GPU access
   - API-based alternatives: Most practical for production with usage-based pricing

4. **Recommended Approach**: Hybrid strategy using Google Colab Pro for development/experimentation and API-based services for production.

## April 7, 2025: Dual-Track Llama 4 Strategy

Today we discussed a dual-track approach for integrating Llama 4 models into the Kern Resources project:

### Strategy Overview

We will pursue a two-pronged approach:

1. **Immediate Implementation**: Use Llama 4 Scout Instruct (8B) as the lead AI for CrewAI
   - Leverage its instruction-following capabilities out-of-the-box
   - Integrate with CrewAI through Ollama or similar API
   - Deploy for immediate use in the application

2. **Parallel Training**: Simultaneously train Llama 4 E (17B) model
   - Use LoRA/QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning on domain-specific data
   - Periodically evaluate against Scout Instruct
   - Gradually transition tasks from Scout to the fine-tuned E model as it improves

### Rationale

This approach offers several advantages:

- **Immediate Functionality**: Get CrewAI working with a capable model right away
- **Learning Opportunity**: Gain insights from training while having a functional system
- **Gradual Improvement**: Incrementally enhance the system as the E model improves
- **Resource Efficiency**: Use the smaller Scout model for most tasks while training the larger E model

### Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Pull Llama 4 Scout Instruct model and integrate with CrewAI
   - Set up Ollama locally
   - Create custom LLM provider for CrewAI
   - Configure CrewAI agents to use the model

2. **Phase 2**: Set up training pipeline for Llama 4 E
   - Prepare domain-specific training data
   - Implement LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning
   - Create evaluation framework

3. **Phase 3**: Gradual transition
   - Identify tasks where fine-tuned E model outperforms Scout
   - Implement model switching based on task requirements
   - Eventually transition fully to fine-tuned E model if performance warrants

### Technical Considerations

- **Environment Configuration**: Need to manage configurations for both models
- **Resource Requirements**: Scout model can run on consumer hardware; E model training will require cloud GPUs
- **API Consistency**: Ensure consistent API interface regardless of which model is being used
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Develop clear metrics to compare model performance

### Next Steps

1. Pull Llama 4 Scout Instruct model and add to GitHub repository
2. Create custom LLM provider for CrewAI integration
3. Test basic functionality with CrewAI agents
4. Begin preparing training data for E model fine-tuning

This dual-track approach allows us to make immediate progress with CrewAI integration while simultaneously working toward a more customized, potentially higher-performing solution with the fine-tuned E model.
