# Llama 4 Deployment Options Exploration

**Date:** April 7, 2025  
**Author:** Kern Resources Team

## Overview

This document explores various deployment options for integrating Llama 4 models with the Kern Resources project, considering hardware requirements, costs, and practical implementation approaches.

## Hardware Requirements

Llama 4 models have significant hardware requirements:

1. **Llama 4 Scout Instruct (8B)**:
   - Minimum: 16GB VRAM (high-end consumer GPU like RTX 3090/4090)
   - Recommended: 24GB+ VRAM for optimal performance
   - CPU-only: Possible but extremely slow (minutes per response)

2. **Llama 4 E (17B)**:
   - Minimum: 32GB VRAM (professional GPUs like A100)
   - Recommended: 40GB+ VRAM
   - CPU-only: Not practical

## Deployment Options Considered

### 1. Local Deployment

**Assessment:** Limited by available hardware (11GB VRAM GPU)
- Sufficient for Llama 3 7B models
- Insufficient for Llama 4 models
- Zero cost (using existing hardware)

**Conclusion:** Viable for development with smaller models, but not for Llama 4.

### 2. Render.com GPU Instances

**Assessment:** Technically viable but cost-prohibitive
- A4000 GPU (16GB VRAM): $1.20/hour or approximately $225/month
- Suitable for Llama 4 Scout Instruct (8B)
- Auto-suspend features available to reduce costs
- Deployment configuration created and tested

**Conclusion:** Too expensive for a hobby project with limited budget.

### 3. Google Colab Pro

**Assessment:** Excellent balance of capability and cost
- A100 GPU (40GB VRAM): $9.99/month for Colab Pro
- Suitable for both Llama 4 Scout Instruct (8B) and Llama 4 E (17B)
- Requires setting up an API endpoint and exposing it via ngrok
- Notebook sessions have time limits (12 hours)
- Not suitable for 24/7 production use

**Conclusion:** Best option for development and experimentation within budget constraints.

### 4. API-Based Alternatives

**Assessment:** Most practical for production use
- OpenAI API: ~$0.50-$1.00 per 100K tokens (GPT-3.5-Turbo)
- Anthropic API: ~$0.70-$1.50 per 100K tokens (Claude)
- Together.ai: ~$0.20-$0.60 per 100K tokens (various models)
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model
- No infrastructure management required

**Conclusion:** Most cost-effective for production use with predictable, usage-based pricing.

### 5. Serverless Options

**Assessment:** Good for occasional use
- Replicate.com: Pay only for compute time used
- Typical costs might be $0.01-$0.05 per inference request
- No ongoing server costs when not in use

**Conclusion:** Good option for occasional use but may become expensive with high volume.

## Implementation Plan

Based on our exploration, we recommend a hybrid approach:

1. **Development & Experimentation**:
   - Use Google Colab Pro with A100 GPU ($9.99/month)
   - Set up Ollama with Llama 4 models in Colab
   - Create a Flask API endpoint exposed via ngrok
   - Connect local code to the Colab-hosted endpoint

2. **Local Development Fallback**:
   - Use local GPU (11GB VRAM) with Llama 3 7B for development when Colab is unavailable
   - Ensures continuous development capability

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Use API-based services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Together.ai)
   - Pay-as-you-go pricing model
   - No infrastructure management required

4. **Future Considerations**:
   - Monitor hardware costs and availability
   - Consider dedicated GPU instances if usage justifies the cost
   - Explore quantized models to reduce hardware requirements

## Technical Implementation Details

### Google Colab Implementation

A Jupyter notebook has been created (`colab/llama4_ollama_api.ipynb`) that:
1. Sets up Ollama on Colab
2. Pulls the Llama 4 Scout Instruct model
3. Creates a Flask API server
4. Exposes the API via ngrok
5. Provides endpoints compatible with our OllamaProvider

### Local Environment Configuration

To connect to the Colab-hosted endpoint:
1. Update the `.env` file:
   ```
   OLLAMA_API_BASE=https://[ngrok-url-from-colab]
   OLLAMA_REMOTE=true
   OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=120
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_llama4_scout.py
   ```

3. Test with CrewAI:
   ```bash
   python integration/crewai_example.py
   ```

## Cost Analysis

| Option | Setup Cost | Monthly Cost | Per-Request Cost | Notes |
|--------|------------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Local GPU (11GB) | $0 | $0 | $0 | Limited to Llama 3 7B |
| Render GPU (A4000) | $0 | ~$225 | $0 | If running 24/7 |
| Google Colab Pro | $0 | $9.99 | $0 | 12-hour session limits |
| OpenAI API | $0 | $0 | ~$0.50-$1.00/100K tokens | Usage-based |
| Together.ai | $0 | $0 | ~$0.20-$0.60/100K tokens | Usage-based |

## Conclusion

For the Kern Resources project, we recommend:

1. **Primary Development Environment**: Google Colab Pro with A100 GPU
2. **Fallback Development**: Local GPU with Llama 3 7B
3. **Production Deployment**: API-based services

This approach balances cost constraints with the need for powerful models, providing a practical path forward for the project while staying within budget limitations.
