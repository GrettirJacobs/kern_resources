# Domain Strategy Decision

**Date:** April 7, 2025  
**Author:** Kern Resources Team

## Overview

This document captures the decision-making process regarding domain strategy for the initial deployment of the Kern Resources application on Render.com. The team evaluated whether to migrate the existing GoDaddy domain (kernresources.com) to Render immediately or to use a Render subdomain for initial testing.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Migrate GoDaddy Domain to Render Immediately

**Approach:** Transfer or point the existing kernresources.com domain to Render from the beginning of the deployment process.

**Positives:**
1. **Production-Ready Environment**: Testing with the actual domain provides a true production environment experience.
2. **Single Migration**: Only need to go through the domain configuration process once.
3. **Immediate Brand Consistency**: Beta testers see the official domain, maintaining brand consistency.
4. **SEO Preparation**: Starts building domain authority and SEO history immediately.
5. **Realistic User Experience**: Testers experience the site exactly as end users will.

**Negatives:**
1. **Migration Complexity**: Domain transfers can be complex and sometimes problematic.
2. **Potential Downtime**: Risk of temporary domain unavailability during the transfer process.
3. **Cost**: Domain transfers typically incur fees (usually around $10-15).
4. **Time-Consuming**: The transfer process can take several days to complete.
5. **Commitment**: Commits to Render before fully testing the platform.
6. **DNS Propagation Delays**: Changes to DNS settings can take 24-48 hours to propagate globally.

### Option 2: Use a Render Subdomain for Initial Testing

**Approach:** Deploy to a free Render subdomain (e.g., kern-resources.onrender.com) for initial testing before configuring the custom domain.

**Positives:**
1. **Zero Cost**: Render provides free subdomains with no additional fees.
2. **Immediate Setup**: Available instantly with no waiting period.
3. **Risk-Free Testing**: Test the platform thoroughly before committing the main domain.
4. **Simplified Process**: No complex domain transfer or DNS configuration required.
5. **Reversibility**: Easy to abandon if Render isn't the right platform.
6. **Parallel Operation**: The existing domain remains untouched during testing.

**Negatives:**
1. **Additional Step Later**: Need to configure the real domain after testing.
2. **Less Realistic Testing**: The testing environment won't perfectly match production.
3. **No Brand Consistency**: Beta testers will see a generic Render subdomain.
4. **No SEO Building**: Any search engine visibility won't transfer to the final domain.
5. **Potential Configuration Differences**: Some settings might need adjustment when moving to the real domain.

## Decision

**We have decided to implement Option 2: Use a Render subdomain for initial testing.**

This decision was made based on the following factors:

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Testing Render's capabilities without risking the domain or incurring costs is the safer approach for a hobby project.

2. **Speed of Implementation**: Getting the test environment up and running immediately allows for faster iteration and feedback.

3. **Learning Opportunity**: This approach provides an opportunity to familiarize ourselves with Render's platform before adding domain complexity.

4. **Simplified Troubleshooting**: If issues arise, we won't have to wonder if they're related to domain configuration.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will proceed as follows:

1. **Initial Deployment**: Deploy the static frontend and backend API to Render using the free subdomains provided by Render.

2. **Testing Phase**: Conduct thorough testing of all functionality in this environment.

3. **Domain Configuration**: Once satisfied with the testing, configure the kernresources.com domain to point to Render:
   - Keep the domain registered at GoDaddy
   - Update the DNS settings to point to Render
   - Configure SSL certificates for the custom domain

4. **Verification**: Verify that everything works correctly with the custom domain before announcing the site publicly.

## Future Considerations

If the project grows significantly or requires specialized domain features, we may reconsider the domain hosting strategy. Factors that would prompt a reevaluation include:

1. Significant cost differences in domain renewal
2. Need for advanced DNS features not provided by GoDaddy
3. Integration requirements with other services

## Conclusion

Starting with a Render subdomain for testing provides the best balance of speed, cost, and risk management for the current phase of the Kern Resources project. This approach allows us to validate the technical implementation before committing to domain configuration changes.
