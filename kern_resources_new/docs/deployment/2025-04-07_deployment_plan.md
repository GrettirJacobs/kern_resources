# Kern Resources Deployment Plan

**Date:** April 7, 2025  
**Author:** Kern Resources Team

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for deploying the Kern Resources application to a production environment. The focus is on setting up both the backend on Render.com and the frontend on a static hosting service, creating a real-world environment for beta testing.

## Deployment Strategy

Our deployment strategy prioritizes:

1. Getting a functional version of the application into a real-world environment quickly
2. Establishing a solid foundation for future development
3. Enabling early feedback from beta testers
4. Identifying deployment or performance issues early

## 1. Set Up Render Backend

### 1.1 Prepare the Application

- [ ] Review and update environment variable configuration
  - Create a `.env.example` file with all required variables
  - Document each variable's purpose and format
  - Ensure sensitive values are not hardcoded

- [ ] Set up database initialization scripts
  - Create a script to run migrations automatically
  - Add seed data for testing purposes
  - Implement database backup procedures

- [ ] Configure logging for production
  - Set appropriate log levels
  - Ensure sensitive information is not logged
  - Configure log rotation and storage

### 1.2 Create Render Web Service

- [ ] Sign up/login to Render.com
  - Create a new account if needed
  - Set up billing information (if using paid features)

- [ ] Connect to GitHub repository
  - Authorize Render to access the repository
  - Select the main branch for deployment

- [ ] Configure the service
  - **Name:** kern-resources-api
  - **Environment:** Python
  - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - **Start Command:** `gunicorn 'app:create_app()' --bind=0.0.0.0:$PORT`
  - **Environment Variables:**
    - `FLASK_ENV=production`
    - `SECRET_KEY=[secure random string]`
    - `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app.db` (or other database URL)
    - Other application-specific variables

- [ ] Deploy the backend API
  - Monitor the build and deployment process
  - Verify the service is running correctly
  - Test basic API endpoints

### 1.3 Set Up Database

- [ ] Configure SQLite for production
  - Ensure database file is stored in a persistent location
  - Set up proper permissions
  - Configure regular backups

- [ ] Alternative: Consider a managed database service
  - Evaluate PostgreSQL on Render if needed
  - Plan for data migration from SQLite if necessary

- [ ] Ensure database migrations run automatically
  - Configure migration script in the build process
  - Test migration process with sample data

## 2. Set Up Frontend Hosting

### 2.1 Prepare the Frontend

- [ ] Create a simple but functional frontend
  - Implement core features (resource browsing, search)
  - Ensure responsive design for mobile users
  - Optimize assets for production

- [ ] Configure API endpoints
  - Update API URL configuration to point to Render backend
  - Implement environment-based configuration
  - Add error handling for API failures

- [ ] Set up build scripts
  - Configure production build process
  - Optimize assets (minification, bundling)
  - Generate static files

### 2.2 Choose Hosting Platform

- [ ] Evaluate options:
  - **Render Static Sites:** Keeps everything in one platform
  - **Netlify:** Excellent CI/CD and form handling
  - **Vercel:** Great for Next.js or React applications

- [ ] Decision criteria:
  - Ease of deployment
  - Integration with existing workflow
  - Free tier limitations
  - Performance and reliability

### 2.3 Deploy Frontend

- [ ] Connect to GitHub repository
  - Authorize chosen platform to access the repository
  - Select main branch for deployment

- [ ] Configure build settings
  - **Build Command:** (e.g., `npm run build` or `yarn build`)
  - **Publish Directory:** (e.g., `build` or `dist`)
  - **Environment Variables:** As needed for the frontend

- [ ] Deploy the static site
  - Monitor the build and deployment process
  - Verify the site is accessible
  - Test core functionality

## 3. Configure Domain

### 3.1 DNS Configuration

- [ ] Point domain to frontend
  - Update DNS records for kernresources.com
  - Configure CNAME or A records as required
  - Set up www subdomain if needed

- [ ] Set up subdomain for backend
  - Create api.kernresources.com subdomain
  - Point to Render backend service
  - Configure SSL certificates

- [ ] Configure CORS
  - Update backend to allow requests from frontend domain
  - Test cross-origin requests
  - Implement proper security headers

## 4. Set Up Monitoring and Analytics

### 4.1 Basic Monitoring

- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
  - Configure Render alerts
  - Consider additional monitoring service (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)

- [ ] Configure error logging
  - Implement centralized error tracking
  - Set up notification system for critical errors

- [ ] Implement basic analytics
  - Add simple analytics to track usage
  - Monitor API performance
  - Track search queries and results

## 5. Beta Testing Plan

### 5.1 Create Testing Instructions

- [ ] Document how to use the application
  - Create user guides for core features
  - Provide screenshots and examples

- [ ] Specify what to test
  - Create a list of features to test
  - Provide expected behavior
  - Suggest edge cases to try

- [ ] Create feedback mechanism
  - Set up a form for reporting issues
  - Create a system for tracking feedback
  - Establish communication channels with testers

### 5.2 Invite Beta Testers

- [ ] Start with a small group
  - Identify 5-10 trusted users
  - Provide detailed instructions
  - Collect initial feedback

- [ ] Gradually expand testing group
  - Add more users as initial issues are resolved
  - Diversify the testing group
  - Collect feedback from different user types

## Timeline

1. **Week 1:** Set up Render backend and deploy API
2. **Week 2:** Deploy frontend and configure domain
3. **Week 3:** Set up monitoring and prepare for beta testing
4. **Week 4:** Begin beta testing with initial group
5. **Weeks 5-6:** Expand beta testing and collect feedback

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered successful when:

1. The backend API is accessible and functioning correctly
2. The frontend is deployed and communicating with the backend
3. The domain is properly configured
4. Basic monitoring is in place
5. Initial beta testers can access and use the application

## Future Considerations

After successful deployment and initial beta testing, we will consider:

1. Implementing UI improvements based on feedback
2. Adding advanced search features (highlighting, faceted search)
3. Optimizing performance based on real-world usage
4. Scaling resources if needed
5. Implementing additional features from the roadmap

## Conclusion

This deployment plan focuses on getting a functional version of the Kern Resources application into a real-world environment quickly. By prioritizing the backend and frontend deployment before adding more features, we'll establish a solid foundation for future development and enable early feedback from beta testers.
