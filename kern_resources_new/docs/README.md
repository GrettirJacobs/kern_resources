# Kern Resources Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Kern Resources project. We follow a systematic approach to documentation to ensure that our development process is well-documented and our code is maintainable.

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized into the following categories:

### `/design/`
Architecture decisions, component interactions, and data flow diagrams. These documents explain the high-level design of the system and the rationale behind key architectural choices.

### `/implementation/`
Detailed notes on how specific features were implemented, challenges encountered, and solutions applied. These documents provide insights into the technical details of the implementation.

### `/api/`
API specifications, including endpoint details, request/response formats, and authentication requirements. These documents serve as a reference for developers working with our APIs.

### `/technical/`
Technical documentation for developers, including implementation details, architecture, and developer guides. These documents provide in-depth technical information for developers working on the project.

### `/user_guides/`
User-facing documentation explaining how to use the system's features. These guides are written in a non-technical language and focus on practical usage.

### `/deployment/`
Deployment plans, configuration guides, and infrastructure documentation. These documents provide instructions for deploying and maintaining the application in various environments.

### `/logs/`
Development logs capturing progress, decisions made during development sessions, and planned next steps. These documents provide a historical record of the development process.

### `/examples/`
Usage examples and tutorials showing how to use different parts of the system. These documents help new developers get up to speed quickly.

## Documentation Checkpoints

We create documentation at these key points:

1. **After Major Milestones**: When we complete a significant feature or component
2. **Before/After Architecture Decisions**: When we make important design choices
3. **At Regular Intervals**: Every 2-3 development sessions to capture progress
4. **When Introducing New Technologies**: When adding new libraries or frameworks
5. **When Refactoring Existing Code**: To explain changes and their rationale

## Documentation Template

We use a standard template for our documentation files:

```markdown
# [Document Title]

## Overview
Brief description of what this document covers.

## Context
Background information and why this work was necessary.

## Implementation Details
Technical details of the implementation.

## Design Decisions
Explanation of key decisions made and alternatives considered.

## Challenges and Solutions
Problems encountered and how they were resolved.

## Future Considerations
Potential improvements or related work for the future.

## Related Documents
Links to other relevant documentation.
```

## Documentation Process

Our process for creating documentation:

1. **Identify Documentation Need**: Determine when documentation is needed based on our checkpoints
2. **Create Draft**: Write initial documentation using our template
3. **Review**: Ensure documentation is clear, accurate, and complete
4. **Link**: Connect documentation to related code and other documents
5. **Update**: Revise documentation when the related code changes

## Naming Conventions

We follow these naming conventions for documentation files:

- Design documents: `YYYY-MM-DD_design_[topic].md`
- Implementation notes: `YYYY-MM-DD_implementation_[feature].md`
- API documentation: `api_[resource]_[version].md`
- Development logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_devlog_[session].md`

## Documentation Best Practices

1. **Be Concise**: Write clearly and to the point
2. **Use Examples**: Include code examples where appropriate
3. **Include Diagrams**: Use diagrams to illustrate complex concepts
4. **Link Related Documents**: Create connections between related documentation
5. **Keep Updated**: Update documentation when code changes
6. **Include Rationale**: Explain why decisions were made, not just what was done
7. **Consider the Audience**: Write for developers who may be new to the project
