## Key Findings

### Backend Hosting
- Render.com's free tier is suitable for development and initial launch
- Be aware of 15-minute inactivity sleep limitation
- Consider upgrading to $7/month tier for always-on service or exploring Fly.io

### Frontend Hosting
- Modern static site hosting (Render Static, Netlify, Vercel) recommended over GoDaddy
- Keep domain registration with GoDaddy but use DNS to point to modern hosting
- Use subdomain structure for clean API integration

### Llama 4 Fine-Tuning
- LoRA/QLoRA techniques make fine-tuning feasible on modest hardware
- Cloud GPU rental services offer affordable options ($2-3/hour)
- Hybrid approach recommended: experiment with fine-tuning, use APIs for production

## Integration with Current Development

This research aligns well with our recent work on:
- FTS5 search implementation
- Llama 4 integration
- GitHub Actions workflows

The recommendations provide a clear path forward for hosting and scaling the Kern Resources project while maintaining budget constraints appropriate for a hobby project.
