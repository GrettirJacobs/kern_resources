2. Frontend Hosting: GoDaddy vs. Better Integration Options

Now turning to the website frontend: you own the domain kernresources.com via GoDaddy, which is currently parked. The question is whether GoDaddy is the best place to host your frontend in the long run, especially in terms of integration with the backend. 

GoDaddy as a Host (Status Quo): GoDaddy is primarily a domain registrar, but it also offers traditional web hosting (shared hosting, WordPress hosting, etc.) for additional fees. Using GoDaddy for hosting might involve buying a hosting plan and deploying your site via FTP or a site builder. For a modern web app (especially if you're building a React/Angular single-page app or a custom static site), GoDaddy's hosting is not particularly streamlined. It's often geared toward simple sites or WordPress blogs and may not integrate with your CI/CD easily.

Pros (GoDaddy hosting): If you needed a simple WordPress site, GoDaddy could bundle domain + hosting, and you'd manage both in one account. They might offer promo pricing for the first year of hosting. It also provides email hosting, etc., if you needed those. Integration-wise, if the backend API is elsewhere, you'd simply call it from your GoDaddy-hosted frontend via the internet (no special integration; just ensure CORS is configured on the API). GoDaddy's hosting can certainly serve static files or PHP, but…

Cons (GoDaddy hosting): Generally, GoDaddy's shared hosting is considered lower-tier in performance and flexibility compared to modern solutions. There's typically no free tier – you'd pay perhaps $5–10/month for basic hosting that gives you a cPanel dashboard. Deployment would not be as developer-friendly (no built-in git deploy or CI). You'd likely have to manually upload files or set up your own deployment script. If your frontend is a static site or a JavaScript bundle, you'd have to manage build and upload yourself. Also, GoDaddy's hosting environment might not easily support modern frameworks out-of-the-box (for example, hosting a Next.js SSR app on GoDaddy would be cumbersome or impossible without a VPS). In short, you can keep GoDaddy as your domain registrar, but it's not the ideal place to host a modern web app's frontend in 2025.

Modern Frontend Hosting Alternatives: Since your frontend is likely going to be a relatively static resource hub interface (with dynamic data fetched from the backend API), you have several excellent, low-cost options:

Render Static Sites: Since you're already using Render for the backend, you can take advantage of Render's Static Site hosting for your frontend. Render allows you to deploy static sites (HTML, CSS, JS, or any static build output from frameworks like React/Vue) for free, including a generous 100 GB/month bandwidth allocation. The process is similar: you connect a repo (or a subfolder of your backend repo) to Render, specify the build command (e.g. npm run build) and output directory, and it will auto-deploy. The static site is served via a global CDN, meaning it's fast for users. Pros: Completely free (unless your traffic exceeds 100 GB, at which point it's $0.10/GB), automated deployments on push, and you can easily set up your custom domain (kernresources.com) on it with Render managing the SSL. Cons: Only suitable for static content – but most frontends these days can be static (even if they are SPAs) and interact with the backend via API calls. There's no built-in server-side rendering on Render's static hosting, but if you needed SSR you could instead deploy a Node service (though that then costs like a backend). For integration, you could host the frontend at the root domain and perhaps the backend at api.kernresources.com (Render allows adding custom domains to services). This separation is common: the domain's DNS can point the root to Render's static site and an api subdomain to the backend service.

Netlify or Vercel: These are specialized platforms for frontend deployments that have excellent free tiers and might even provide a smoother experience for static or JAMstack sites. Netlify, for example, is often the first choice for front-end developers deploying static sites due to its generous free plan. Netlify offers continuous deployment from Git, free SSL, form handling, and other goodies. Its free tier includes features like 300 build minutes per month (plenty for a hobby project) and enough bandwidth for most small sites (they don't hard-limit bandwidth for free, as long as usage is reasonable). Vercel is another top option, especially if you use Next.js or other frameworks – it supports both static and serverless functions. Vercel's free tier gives you 6,000 build minutes/month and also global CDN hosting. Both Netlify and Vercel allow custom domain mapping (you'd just point DNS CNAME records to them). Pros: Extremely developer-friendly – push to GitHub and your site updates; both platforms handle atomic deploys, rollbacks, etc. They also have features like preview deployments on pull requests which could be nice if you collaborate in the future. Cons: They are separate from your backend platform, so you'd manage two platforms (though that's not a big downside). Integration with backend is basically just calling your Render API via its URL – you might need to enable CORS on the API to allow the Netlify/Vercel domain to request it. Also, if you eventually want the front and back on the same domain for cookie sharing or SEO reasons, that's a bit trickier when they're on different services (but still doable via subdomains or proxies). For most cases, having them separate is fine.

Other static hosting: GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc. GitHub Pages is totally free and reliable for static content, but it's a bit less flexible (for example, it doesn't easily handle SPAs without some config for client-side routing). Also, it doesn't automatically build your React app unless you use Actions – it's often used for purely static Markdown or documentation sites. Cloudflare Pages is a newer service by Cloudflare to host static sites on their CDN. It has unlimited free bandwidth and automatic builds, plus Cloudflare's DNS could manage your domain if you transfer it. Cloudflare Pages free tier allows 500 builds per month and unlimited sites, with functions (if you need) limited by execution time. Cloudflare's network is extremely fast, and if you use Cloudflare DNS for your domain, the integration is seamless. Pros: Very fast, very free. Cons: Slightly more technical to set up (not much, though) and doesn't have the same UI polish as Netlify. Since Cloudflare is also a DNS provider, you could move your domain there to simplify things (they often have cheaper domain renewal rates than GoDaddy too, and free DNS services).

Domain and Integration Considerations: Regardless of where you host the frontend, you can keep the domain at GoDaddy and just point it to the host. Typically, you'd update the DNS A record or CNAME record in GoDaddy's DNS manager to point to your hosting provider's addresses. For example, if using Render for static, you'd add a CNAME for www.kernresources.com to Render's provided domain and an A record for the root if needed (Render provides instructions and even an ALIAS solution for root). If using Netlify, you'd do similar: Netlify will provide some DNS targets to add. The process is well-documented (e.g., many tutorials exist for connecting a GoDaddy domain to Netlify). Because you specifically mention "integration with the backend", one thing to highlight: If frontend and backend are on the same top-level domain (e.g., frontend at kernresources.com and backend at api.kernresources.com), you can set cookies or auth tokens on that domain and they'll be shared, and you avoid cross-origin issues. If they're on different domains (e.g., frontend on Netlify domain or another domain entirely), you'd have to deal with CORS and possibly slightly more complex auth. The simplest way to ensure smooth integration is:

Use your custom domain for both. For instance, host the frontend at kernresources.com (or www.kernresources.com) and the backend at api.kernresources.com. This way, both are under kernresources.com. You can configure CORS on the backend to allow requests from the frontend origin, or even open it up if needed. This setup is doable even if the providers are different: you just manage DNS records accordingly (one subdomain to Render, one to Netlify, etc.).

Alternatively, you could host both on the same platform. For instance, you might decide to host the frontend on Render as a static site and the backend as a service. Then Render could serve both under one domain via different paths (though Render doesn't natively do path-based routing between services). More commonly, you'd still do subdomains in that case. The advantage is just a single dashboard for both.

Costs: Nearly all the modern hosting options for a static frontend are free (at least at the hobby scale). Render static is free, Netlify and Vercel have free plans, Cloudflare Pages is free. GoDaddy's hosting is not free (aside from just parking the domain). So from a purely budget perspective, moving off GoDaddy's hosting and onto a free static host is a win. You'll still keep the domain (you'll continue to pay GoDaddy's annual domain fee unless you transfer out). If you are inclined, you might transfer the domain to a registrar like Namecheap or Cloudflare Registrar to save a few dollars per year and get arguably better DNS management, but that's optional. GoDaddy as a registrar is fine if you're comfortable with their interface; it's just their hosting that's not ideal. 

Recommendation – Frontend: Do not lock yourself into GoDaddy's website hosting for the long term. Instead, leverage a free static hosting platform for your frontend. A great approach is to deploy the frontend on Render's static site service, since you're already using Render (one less account to manage). This gives you a no-cost, CDN-backed hosting with easy integration – you can manage both front and back in one dashboard and use the same Git workflow. Alternatively, Netlify or Vercel are equally excellent – if you prefer their developer experience or features, you can't go wrong with either. Netlify, for instance, would allow you to deploy your site by simply pushing to GitHub; it will handle the build and publish steps and even give you a preview URL for each commit. Many developers favor Netlify's simple CLI and rich features (forms, identity, serverless functions) for frontends, while Vercel is very optimized for React/Next.js workflows. For integration, map your domain to the chosen frontend host and use an api. subdomain for the backend. On the backend, enable CORS for the domain or set up any needed headers so that browser requests from your frontend can hit the API. If using Render for both, you can set CORS to allow https://kernresources.com and https://www.kernresources.com (and perhaps even use an internal connection if it's possible, though likely it will still go over public internet). In summary, the best long-term setup is: GoDaddy (or another registrar) holds your domain, but the frontend is hosted on a modern platform that offers a free tier and easy deployments, and the backend is on Render (or similar). This separation of concerns gives you flexibility to update the front and back independently, and maximizes use of free services – very much in line with a budget-conscious project. (One more note: If your site needs server-side rendering or is not a static SPA, consider deploying it on a platform like Vercel which can handle Next.js SSR on their free tier. But if it's mostly a client-side app loading data via API, static hosting is perfect.)
