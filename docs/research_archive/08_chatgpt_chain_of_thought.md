## Analysis of Research Process

This chain of thought reveals ChatGPT's systematic approach to researching the three main questions:

1. **Information Gathering Phase**
   - Started with broad searches about Render.com, GoDaddy, and Llama 4
   - Explored multiple sources including Hugging Face, AWS documentation, Reddit, and official provider websites
   - Conducted targeted searches to fill knowledge gaps (e.g., "Render vs Railway pricing")

2. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Consistently compared multiple options rather than focusing on a single solution
   - Evaluated trade-offs between cost, ease of use, and performance
   - Considered both technical capabilities and practical constraints

3. **Budget-Conscious Approach**
   - Repeatedly focused on free tiers and budget-friendly options
   - Investigated specific pricing details and limitations
   - Sought out real-world examples of low-cost implementations (e.g., "$8 fine-tuning")

4. **Holistic Perspective**
   - Considered how the different components (backend, frontend, AI) would integrate
   - Evaluated both immediate implementation needs and future scalability
   - Balanced technical capabilities with practical constraints

The research process demonstrates a thorough, methodical approach to answering complex questions with multiple interdependent factors. ChatGPT explored a wide range of sources, compared multiple options, and focused on practical, budget-conscious solutions appropriate for a hobby project.
