# Initial Prompt to ChatGPT for Kern Resources Project Research

## Date: April 6, 2025

```
I currently own the domain kernresources.com (https://www.afternic.com/forsale/kernresources.com?utm_source=TDFS_DASLNC&utm_medium=parkedpages&utm_campaign=x_corp_tdfs-daslnc_base&traffic_type=TDFS_DASLNC&traffic_id=daslnc&). It is hosted by GoDaddy.com.

I have an idea for how I would like to use that domain. I am developing a codebase https://github.com/GrettirJacobs/kern_resources

See https://github.com/GrettirJacobs/kern_resources/blob/main/README.md

See https://github.com/GrettirJacobs/kern_resources/tree/main/creative_lab/llama4_exp

https://github.com/GrettirJacobs/kern_resources/blob/main/creative_lab/llama4_exp/README.md

The purpose of the codebase will be to act as a backend for KernResources.com. In turn, KernResources.com's purpose will be to act as a routinely updating resource suggestion hub for Kern County, California social service agency employees. 

At present, the plan will be to use Render.com as the cloud service for backend inference, once the the creative laboratory codebase is developed and the Llama 4 model fine-tuned. This leaves three very important questions that should be decided sooner rather than later:

1. Is Render the best option for backend?
2. Is GoDaddy the right service for hosting the website?
3. What will be the best plan for fine-tuning the Llama 4 model?

Please conduct deep research to answer these three questions. As you do, please keep in mind that I am doing all of this as a hobby project. I am not a professional programmer and I do not have the sort of monetary or time resources which an institution might have. The compute, monetary, and labor budget for this project must necessarily be an important consideration for all aspects of the plan.

I do have paid accounts with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Grok, so I do have access to state of the art frontier LLM models
```

## Context

This prompt was sent to ChatGPT to request detailed research on three key aspects of the Kern Resources project:

1. Backend hosting options (evaluating Render.com)
2. Website hosting options (evaluating GoDaddy)
3. Llama 4 model fine-tuning strategies

The research was requested with specific constraints in mind:
- This is a hobby project with limited resources
- Budget considerations are important
- The developer is not a professional programmer
- The project has access to frontier LLM models through paid accounts
