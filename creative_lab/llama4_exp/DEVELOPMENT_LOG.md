# Development Log - Llama 4 Integration

## Session Summary - June 12, 2024

### Completed Tasks

1. **FTS5 Search Implementation**
   - Implemented SQLite FTS5 (Full-Text Search) for resource search
   - Created standalone search API for testing and AI integration
   - Successfully found 86 resources matching "food" (compared to 0 with previous approach)
   - Added faceted search capabilities (filtering by category, status)

2. **Search API Development**
   - Created dedicated search API with JSON responses
   - Implemented endpoints:
     - `GET /api/search?q={query}` for searching resources
     - `GET /api/resource/{resource_id}` for getting resource details
   - Added web interface for testing the API

3. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the FTS5 implementation
   - Added technical specification for next steps
   - Documented AI integration examples

4. **Database Enhancements**
   - Set up FTS5 virtual table for resources
   - Created triggers to keep the index in sync with the resources table
   - Implemented fallback to regular search if FTS5 is not available

### Current Status
- FTS5 search API working correctly
- Main application search partially integrated
- Documentation complete
- Test scripts created and verified
- Llama 4 integration successfully merged to GitHub repository (PR #1)
- Flask API for Llama 4 Scout 17B-E model implemented

### Next Steps
1. **Fix Main Application Search**
   - Debug and fix integration issues
   - Implement simplified two-step approach
   - Add comprehensive logging

2. **Implement Synonym Support**
   - Create synonym dictionary for common terms
   - Expand search queries to include synonyms
   - Add synonym management UI

3. **Add Search Highlighting**
   - Implement highlighting of matching terms
   - Update templates to display highlighted content

4. **Enhance Faceted Search**
   - Improve UI for filtering
   - Add support for combining multiple filters

5. **Optimize for AI Integration**
   - Create specialized endpoints for AI consumption
   - Add resource relationships
   - Implement authentication for API access

6. **Llama 4 Integration**
   - ✅ Successfully merged pull request "Feature/llama4 integration new" to GitHub repository
   - ✅ Added Flask-based API service for Llama 4 Scout 17B-E model
   - Configure Render cloud server for model deployment
   - Integrate FTS5 search API with Llama 4 model
   - Set up API endpoints for AI-powered search

### Technical Notes
- Using SQLite FTS5 for full-text search
- Implemented two-step search approach:
  1. Get matching resource IDs using FTS5
  2. Apply filters using SQLAlchemy ORM
- Created synchronization triggers to keep the index updated
- Added fallback to regular search when FTS5 is not available
- Planning to integrate with Llama 4 model (meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-E) on Render cloud server
- FTS5 search API designed to be easily consumed by AI models

### Issues Addressed
1. Resolved database path discovery issues
2. Fixed case sensitivity in search queries
3. Implemented proper error handling for FTS5 availability
4. Added robust logging for search operations

### Resources
- [SQLite FTS5 Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html)
- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [SQLAlchemy Documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/)
