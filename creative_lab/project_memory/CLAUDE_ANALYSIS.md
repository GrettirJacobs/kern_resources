## Test Instructions for Claude Code

### Task 1: Code Analysis
1. Read and analyze this YAML structure
2. Identify the core architectural components
3. Explain how these components interact
4. Point out potential scalability considerations

### Task 2: Implementation Challenge
Create a simplified version of this system that demonstrates:
1. Vector-based content storage
2. Automatic summarization
3. Semantic search capabilities
4. Basic web interface

### Task 3: Testing Strategy
Develop a testing approach that covers:
1. Unit tests for core functions
2. Integration tests for component interaction
3. Performance benchmarks for:
   - Summary generation speed
   - Search response time
   - Vector embedding generation

### Task 4: Enhancement Proposals
Suggest improvements for:
1. Performance optimization
2. Additional features
3. Better error handling
4. Enhanced security

## Evaluation Criteria
Your implementation will be evaluated on:
1. Code quality and organization
2. Test coverage and methodology
3. Documentation clarity
4. Understanding of vector search concepts
5. Implementation of AI-powered features
6. Error handling and edge cases
7. Performance considerations

## Getting Started
1. First, analyze this file and the existing project structure
2. Propose your implementation approach
3. Create a new project with the suggested structure
4. Implement core features incrementally
5. Add tests as you develop
6. Document your progress and decisions

## Success Metrics
Your implementation should demonstrate:
1. Correct understanding of vector-based search
2. Effective use of AI for summarization
3. Clean, maintainable code structure
4. Comprehensive test coverage
5. Clear documentation
6. Scalable architecture decisions

## Notes
