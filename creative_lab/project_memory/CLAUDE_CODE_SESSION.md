# Claude Code Session Log - February 26, 2025

## Session Overview
This document records a Claude Code session exploring the implementation of a Project Memory System.

## Environment Setup
1. Started WSL Ubuntu-22.04
2. Created project directory:
```bash
mkdir claude-projects
cd claude-projects
```

## Project Initialization
1. Created CLAUDE.md with project guidelines
2. Created claude_memory_system directory
3. Copied kern_resources project files:
```bash
cp -r /mnt/c/Users/ErikzConfuzer/kern_resources/creative_lab/project_memory/* claude_memory_system/
```

## Implementation Progress
Claude Code began implementing enhanced versions of core components:

1. Vector Store Implementation (memory_store/vector_store.py):
   - Flexible storage options (in-memory/server)
   - Automatic collection management
   - Vector operations (add, search, delete)
   - Error handling and logging

2. Embedding Generator (memory_store/embeddings.py):
   - Text to vector conversion
   - Batch processing
   - Similarity calculations
   - Memory-efficient operations

3. Summarizer Component (memory_store/summarizer.py):
   - Model-based summarization
   - Fallback extractive summarization
   - Long text handling
   - Headline generation

## Test Suite
Comprehensive test suite including:
- Component-specific tests
- Integration tests
- Performance tests
- Edge case handling

## Next Steps
To continue this implementation:

1. Start WSL:
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04
```

2. Navigate to project:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/ErikzConfuzer/claude-projects/claude_memory_system
```

3. Start Claude Code:
```bash
claude
```

4. Continue implementation:
   - Complete remaining components
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Implement proposed enhancements
   - Update documentation

## Notes
- The implementation shown in the session was theoretical - actual files need to be created
- Claude Code demonstrated understanding of the project structure but physical implementation is needed
- Next session should focus on creating actual working components
