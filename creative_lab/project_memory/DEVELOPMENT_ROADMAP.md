## Implementation Guidelines

### Priority Matrix
```
High Impact/Low Effort:
- Basic authentication
- Tagging system
- Basic backup system

High Impact/High Effort:
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Multi-modal support
- External integrations

Low Impact/Low Effort:
- Theme support
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Basic sorting options

Low Impact/High Effort:
- Complex analytics
- Advanced visualizations
- Real-time collaboration
```

### Development Principles
1. **Iterative Development**
   - Release improvements in small, testable increments
   - Gather user feedback after each iteration
   - Adjust priorities based on usage patterns

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Keep components loosely coupled
   - Design for extensibility
   - Maintain clear interfaces

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Maintain 80% test coverage
   - Include performance benchmarks
   - Add integration tests for new features

### Resource Allocation
```yaml
team_structure:
  backend:
    - python_developer
    - database_specialist
  frontend:
    - react_developer
    - ux_designer
  ml:
    - ml_engineer
    - data_scientist
```

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing the suggested improvements while maintaining the system's core strengths. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a coherent development process.
